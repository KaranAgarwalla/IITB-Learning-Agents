## CS 747 - Foundations of Intelligent Learning Agents

Programming Assignments

1. Implemented various algorithms - **Epsilon Greedy**, **UCB**, **KL-UCB**, **Thompson Sampling** and **Thompson Sampling with Sorted Means** and compared the regrets over different horizons.
2. Implemented **Value Iteration**, **Linear Programming solver** and **Howard's Policy Iteration** to find the optimal policy and the corresponding value function for the given MDP. Used the solvers to find **shortest path** for given **maze**
